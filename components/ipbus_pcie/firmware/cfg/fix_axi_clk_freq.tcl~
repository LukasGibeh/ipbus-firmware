# From Vivado 2020.2.2 (i.e. from IP core 4.1 revision 10) there
# appears to be a bug which causes the AXI clock frequency to be half
# of what was requested if the CPLL is being used. So as a workaround
# until we find a better solution, in that circumstance we ask for
# double the clock frequency that we want. (See also:
# https://gitlab.cern.ch/p2-xware/firmware/emp-fwk/-/issues/26.)
